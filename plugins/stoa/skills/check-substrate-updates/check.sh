# check.sh — substrate-update full-picture drift detection.
#
# Reads substrate/consumer-workspaces.txt (or one workspace passed via
# --workspace), and for each registered workspace emits a composite verdict
# across three orthogonal categories: DRIFTED (deployed file differs from
# source-after-substitutions), MISSING (source-side file not present at its
# expected deployed path — typically a substrate addition the workspace hasn't
# picked up), and OBSOLETE (workspace file at a substrate-deployable path no
# longer in source — typically a removed or renamed skill / CAPTAIN). Verdicts
# compose (e.g. "DRIFTED + MISSING + OBSOLETE"). Per-category file lines use
# distinct prefixes (- drifted, + missing, ! obsolete) so apply.sh's
# --all-differing harvester only ever picks up DRIFTED. A per-workspace
# uncommitted-.claude/-state count is surfaced separately as a pre-flight
# warning before any apply.sh --yes invocation. Routing footer is
# per-category-conditional and tier-branched (project / subproject). The skill
# does NOT classify *why* a file drifted (local edit vs upstream advance vs
# both) — PRINCIPAL memory + the workspace's git history of .claude/ remains
# canonical for that.
#
# Usage:
#   check.sh                              # scan all workspaces in registry
#   check.sh --workspace <path>           # scan a single workspace
#   check.sh --registry <path>            # use a non-default registry file
#
# Output: human-readable per-workspace summary; exit code is always 0 on
# successful execution. Drift is informational, not failure.
